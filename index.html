<h1>This is the <em>best</em> website.</h1>

It is perfect!

<h1>What else do you want!</h1>

</header>
The perfect website:
<ul>
<li>Loads fast.</li>
<li>Looks the same on all browsers.</li>
<li>Fits on all screens.</li>
<li>Accessible to all users.</li>
<li>Legible and gets you point across.</li>
</ul>

The point of a website is to show text.

Stop doing more.
	
<h1>Remote fonts suck.</h1>

Loading 500MB of fonts to render 1MB of content? <em>Stop</em>. Users wont even notice.

<h1>STOP with the gray text.</h1>

<a href="http://contrastrebellion.com/">Text contrast is not bad</a>. Gray text is unreadable on a shitty screen or by the elderly.

If you want your site to be read, make your text readable.

<h1>Why my website is the best.</h1>
	
<h1>It's html 5</h1>
	
It has the proper tags so your browser knows shit is supposed to be. (heading,footer,etc)
	
<h1>It's lightweight</h1>

This entire page is smaller than one logo on your site. Did you just pull in 500MB of javascript to animate a div?

Or 200MB of fonts to write "my site" on the top 50 pixels of your site? 

<h1>It's responsive</h1>

Responsive means it looks good on all screen sizes, <em>not</em> pulling in a fucking 500MB of javascript.

<h1>It <strong>works</strong></h1>

It gets my point across, that is all a <em>website</em> should do.
